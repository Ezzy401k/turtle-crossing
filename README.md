# Turtle Crossing Game

This Python program is a simple implementation of the classic Frogger game using the Turtle graphics library.

## How it Works

The game consists of a player-controlled frog that must navigate across a busy road and a river to reach the other side safely. The player must avoid colliding with moving cars and floating logs while crossing. Points are awarded for successfully reaching the other side, and the game ends if the frog collides with an obstacle or falls into the water.

## Features

- Player-controlled frog movement.
- Randomly generated cars and logs.
- Collision detection with obstacles.
- Scoreboard to track points.
- Game over screen when the frog collides with an obstacle.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Turtle graphics library

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezzy401k/turtle-crossing.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd turtle-crossing
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python turtle-crossing.py
```

4. Use the arrow keys to control the frog and navigate it across the road and river.

5. Avoid colliding with cars and falling into the water. Score points by reaching the other side safely.

## Example

```python
python turtle-crossing.py
```

```
Game Over! Your score: 10
```
